# vscode-hare-highlighting

This extension provides syntax highlighting for the [Hare](https://harelang.org/) language in VSCode.
In addition, the [TextMate Language](./syntaxes/hare.tmLanguage.json) could be usefull 

## Features

This extension only provides syntax highlighting, but no code completion or intellisense.

## Requirements

This extension is stand alone, and does not require a hare installation.

## Extension Settings

None.

## Known Issues

Hare is still evolving, so the syntax may be out of date. Additionaly, this is currently a work in progress, where non trivial ammounts of the grammer have been taken from [the rust extension](https://github.com/rust-lang/vscode-rust/blob/b1ae67b06640ffab6e1ebb72e07364b4477dfbf1/rust-analyzer/editors/code/rust.tmGrammar.json). This means the details almost certainly slightly wrong.

## Release Notes

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for a list of changes.
